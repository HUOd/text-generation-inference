# Tensor Parallelism

Tensor parallelism is a technique used to fit a large model in multiple GPUs. For example, when multiplying the input tensors with the first weight tensor, multiplying both tensors is equivalent to splitting the weight tensor column-wise, multiplying each column with input separately, and then concatenating the separate outputs. These outputs are then sent between GPUs and then concatenated together to get the final result, like below ðŸ‘‡

<Tip warning={true}>

Tensor Parallelism only works for models officially supported, it will not work when falling back on `transformers`. You can get more information about unsupported models [here](./basic_tutorials/non_core_models.md).

</Tip>

You can learn more in-depth about tensor-parallelism from `transformers` docs in this [link](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/perf_train_gpu_many#tensor-parallelism).
